## Description

The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js back end to retrieve note data from a JSON file. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

When I open the Note Taker I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When I click on the link to the notes page I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When I click on the Save icon the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column. When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
